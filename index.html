    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>2.how to change the state by passing props in functional components?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In functional component To make the state change</li>
        <li>functional component gives us a setState function that allows us to update the value of the state</li>
        <li>The setState function has the following syntax</li>
        <li>callback is an optional function that gets executed once the state is successfully updated</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>3.Tell me about redux?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Redux is the open source java-script libarary</li>
        <li>By using Redux we can managing state</li>
        <li>By Redux, the state of your application is kept in a store, and each component can access any state that it needs from this store.</li>
    </ul>
   <hr>
   <h3>4.what is closure?</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Clourses is a nested function containting inner funnction and outer function which can acsees the global variable and outer acess variable</li>
    <li>A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state </li>
    <li>Closures are frequently used in JavaScript for object data privacy, in event handlers and callback functions</li>
   </ul>

<hr>
<h3>explain the major part of the projects</h3>
<li>React-Blog Project</li>
<li>Ecommerce-app Project</li>
<hr>
<h3>What is express?</h3>
<li>Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. </li>
<li>It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application</li>
<li>Express was created to make APIs and web applications with easy</li>
<hr>
<h3>Is express a Library or Framework?</h3>
<li>Express is the most popular Node web framework, </li> 
<li>It is underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks</li>
<hr>
<h3>What is CORS?What does it do?</h3>
<li>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism </li>
<li>It allows a server to indicate  its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.</li>
<hr>
<h3>If we run the project on same system from of both frontend and backend, we will have to use CORS</h3>
<li>Yes we will have to use CORS both frontend and backend in project</li>
<hr>
<h3>What is routing</h3>
<li>Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint</li>
<li>which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).</li>
<li>In simple terms, Routing allows targeting different routes or different URLs on our page.</li>
<hr>
<h3>What is App. JSon</h3>
<li>app. json is a manifest format for describing web apps. </li>
<li> It declares environment variables, add-ons, and other information required to run an app </li>
<hr>
<h3>What is App.Get</h3>
<li>The app.get() function routes the HTTP GET Requests to the path</li>
<li> which is being specified with the specified callback functions. </li>
<li>Basically, it is intended for binding the middleware to your application.</li>
<hr>
<h3>What is synchronous and asynchornous</h3>
<li>The differences between asynchronous and synchronous include: Async is multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel.</li>
<li>Sync is single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time.</li>
<li>Async is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server.</li>
<hr>
<h3>what is module in node js</h3>
<li>Module in Node. js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files</li>
<li>Each module in Node. js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope.</li>
<hr>
<h3>How does routing work in your project</h3>
<li>By using Routing we can switch the one page to another page in our project we can install react-router-dom</li>
<hr>
<h3>How many types of requests can you push in postman</h3>
<li>Types of requests in postMan</li>
<li>Get</li>
<li>put</li>
<li>Post</li>
<li>Update</li>
<li>Delete</li>
<hr>
<h3>How to send data from frontend to backend through post methos</h3>
<li>By using the fetch and axios we can send the data from front-end to backend</li>
<li> The Fetch API is a modern way to send data from the front-end to the back-end.</li>
<li>It's built into modern browsers and allows you to send and receive data asynchronously.</li>
<hr>
<h3>What is JWT Token</h3>
<li>SON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object. </li>
<li>This information can be verified and trusted</li>
<li>Because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret</li>
<hr>
<h3>How do you use JWT Token</h3>
<li>Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.</li>
<li>Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. </li>
<hr>
<h3>What is use state</h3>
<li>useState is React Hook that allows you to add state to a functional component.</li>
<li>It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it.</li>
<li>The Hook takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an updated state value </li>
<hr>
<h3>What is set state</h3>
<li> allows you to change state in a React class component</li>
<li>To change the state of a function component, you use the useState() hook</li>
<li>setState() enqueues change to the component state and tell React that this component and its children need to be re-rendered with the updated state.</li>
<hr>
<h3>cReate a react app.,</h3>
<li>We can Install React-router-dom</li>
<hr>
<h3>can we change value of props from parent component to child component</h3>
<li>Yes we change value of props from parent component to child component</li>
<hr>
<h3>1.state and props</h3>
<li>State:The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. </li>
<li>Props:the props are a type of object where the value of attributes of a tag is stored</li>
<h3>Call Back and Event Loop</h3>
<li>callback:A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function,This technique allows a function to call another function,A callback function can run after another function has finished</li>
<li>Event Loop:
    Image result for what is event loop
    The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack.</li>
    <hr>
<h3>how can change the props value with implementation and toggle</h3>
<pre>
    const myElement = <Car name="Ford" />;
    function Car(props) {
        return <h2>I am a { props.name }</h2>;
      }
</pre>
<hr>
<h3>What is ID & Class</h3>
<li>ID:While an ID is specific to a single element</li>
<li>Class:classes can be assigned to multiple elements on a page or throughout the website.</li>
<li>They are not unique. And while a single element can only have one ID, </li>
<li>They can have multiple classes. Classes are denoted by a period, followed by the class name.</li>
<hr>
<h3>asyn and await- Explain</h3>
<li>The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior</li>
<li>It is to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains</li>
<li>Inside an async function, you can use the await keyword before a call to a function that returns a promise. </li>
<hr>
<h3>What are function component and class component</h3>
<li>It is the state less component</li>
<li>Functional Component:Functional components are nothing but JavaScript functions and therefore can be declared using an arrow function or the function keyword</li>
<pre> function card(props){
    return(
       <div className="main-container">
         <h2>Title of the card</h2>
       </div>
     )
    }
    const card = (props) =>{
     return(
       <div className="main-container">
         <h2>Title of the card</h2>
       </div>
     )
    }</pre>
    <li>Class Component:It is the state full component</li>
<li>Class Component:Before React 16.8, Class components were the only way to track state and lifecycle on a React component. Function components were considered "state-less".</li>
<li>With the addition of Hooks, Function components are now almost equivalent to Class components. The differences are so minor that you will probably never need to use a Class component in React.</li>
<hr>
<h3>Why is React used ?</h3>
<li>It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript. </li>
<li>One of the main benefits of using React JS is its potential to reuse components</li>
<li>In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent </li>
<hr>
<h3>Can we change props data ?</h3>
<li>we cannot change or modify props inside the component as they are immutable</li>
<hr>
<h3>How to handle APIs ?</h3>
<li>We can handle the APIs by using useEffect Hook in that using the Fetch & Axios these are to be used to handle the APIs</li>
<hr>
<h3>How to send data via POST and GET methods ?</h3>
<li>We can install body parser firstly</li>
<li>To send data using the HTTP POST method</li>
<li> you must include the data in the body of the HTTP POST message and specify the MIME type of the data with a Content-Type header</li>
<hr>
<h3>Node is single or multi threaded? With example explanation.</h3>
<li>Node. js runs JavaScript code in a single thread, which means that your code can only do one task at a time</li>
<li>we can say Node. js is single-threaded but the catch is that there are some libraries in Node.</li>
<li>However, Node. js itself is multithreaded and provides hidden threads through the libuv library</li>
<hr>
<h3>Middlewares</h3>
<li>The middleware in node. js is a function that will have all the access for requesting an object</li>
<li>It can responding to an object, and moving to the next middleware function in the application request-response cycle</li>
<li>Two Types of middle wares are:</li>
<li>GlobaL-level</li>
<li>Route-level</li>
<hr>
<h3>OTP generation and verification explanation, sudo example.</h3>
<li> Creating a TwoAccount. Go to Two's new account page, sign up for an account, and provide your details. </li>
<li>Configuration of Two Account</li>
<li>Giving Details of Two accounts </li>
<li>Lastly we can authorize the userDetails</li>
<li>These is the process of OTP generation and verification </li>
